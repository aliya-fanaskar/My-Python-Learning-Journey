# Python Programming for Data Analysis

I’ve been learning and actively practicing Python programming for Data Analysis and decided to organize my work in one place.  This repository contains my Jupyter notebooks — starting from the basics and gradually moving through sequences, branching, iterations, functions, NumPy, Pandas, and beyond.


#### Tools & Environment

- **Language**: Python 3.x  
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook

#### Purpose

- Document my **hands-on practice** with Python.
- Continuously learn and build a strong foundation in Python for Data Analysis
- Build a **reference repo** that I (and others) can revisit anytime.

It’s a work-in-progress repo that I’ll keep updating as I learn and explore more concepts and techniques.
