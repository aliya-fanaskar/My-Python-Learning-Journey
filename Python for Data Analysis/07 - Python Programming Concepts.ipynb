    "The Python documentation refers to the official and comprehensive collection of resources that explain the Python programming language, its standard library, and how to use it effectively. It is a crucial resource for developers of all skill levels, from beginners to advanced users. It serves as the authoritative and detailed manual for everything related to Python, providing the information necessary to understand, use, and develop with the language.\n",

    "- **Structure and Content**: The documentation is organized into various sections, including:\n",
    "  - **Tutorials and Guides**: For beginners and those looking to understand specific concepts.\n",
    "  - **Library Reference**: Detailed explanations of all built-in functions, types, and modules within the Python Standard Library. This is often the most frequently used section.\n",
    "  - **Language Reference**: A formal description of Python's syntax and semantics.\n",
    "  - **Installing Python Modules**: Information on how to install and manage third-party packages.\n",
    "  - **FAQs**: Answers to commonly asked questions.\n",
    "  - **Developer Information**: Details about Python's C API, PEPs (Python Enhancement Proposals), and other advanced topics.\n",
    "  - **Format**: The documentation is available online in HTML format, and also in downloadable formats like PDF and plain text for offline access.\n",
    "  - **Generation**: It is generated from reStructuredText sources using Sphinx, a powerful documentation generator.\n",
    "  - **Docstrings**: A crucial part of Python documentation, docstrings are multi-line string literals used to document modules, classes, functions, and methods within the code itself. These are often extracted and integrated into the broader project documentation.\n",

    "Python supports the core principles of object-oriented programming, which are the building blocks for designing robust and reusable software. These are:\n",
    "#### Object\n",
    "An object represents a specific implementation of the class and holds its own data. It is an instance of a class.\\\n",
    "An object consists of:\n",
    "- State : It is represented by the attributes and reflects the properties of an object.\n",
    "- Behaviour : It is represented by the methods of an object and reflects the response of an object to other objects.\n",
    "- Identity : It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Class\n",
    "A class is a collection of objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the created objects (instances) can have. These attributes are variables that belong to a class and are always public and can be accessed using the dot (.) operator.\\\n",
    "They are blueprints for creating objects.\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Encapsulation\n",
    "Wrapping data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit (class).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inheritance\n",
    "One class can inherit properties / methods from another class. It supports hierarchical classification and promotes code reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Polymorphism\n",
    "Same method behaves differently depending on the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Abstraction\n",
    "Hiding implementation details and showing only essential features."
